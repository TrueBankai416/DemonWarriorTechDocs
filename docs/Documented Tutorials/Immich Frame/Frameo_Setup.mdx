## Overview
Frameo digital photo frames are WiFi-connected devices designed for displaying photos and videos. They allow users to share images directly from their smartphones using the Frameo mobile app, making it easy to keep loved ones updated with new memories.

### Frameo Hardware
Example Hardware Used

[FRAMEO Digital Photo Frame, 10.1 Inch WiFi](https://www.amazon.com/FRAMEO-Digital-Picture-Storage-Auto-Rotate/dp/B09QX7M71C)

### Frameo Install
ImmichFrame can be run on inexpensive Frameo digital photo frames with some additional effort. You can typically find these for ~$40 USD. These devices are low powered and run a very old Android version, so they cannot run the full WebView version of the app (however most of the main features are still supported except SplitView). We have found a method to update the WebView, but it is not without risks, see Frameo Webview Update below.  
 If you have not already, you will need to install ADB on your PC ([ADB instructions][ADB-link]).
ADB is often enabled on these devices by default, if it is not go to Frameo Settings-About-Enable Beta Program. Toggle ADB Access On-Off-On. Use the ADB commands below to sideload ImmichFrame APK, configure it to your liking, then disable the Frameo app to to set ImmichFrame as default Home app:
  - Sideload ImmichFrame:
    ```bash
    adb install /path/to/ImmichFrame_vXX.apk
    ```
  - Update existing ImmichFrame:
    ```bash
    adb install -r /path/to/ImmichFrame_vXX.apk
    ```
  - Start ImmichFrame:
    ```bash
    adb shell am start com.immichframe.immichframe/.MainActivity
    ```
    - Swipe down to enter ImmichFrame Settings
    - Configure URL and Authorization Secret (optional)
    - Disable WebView
  - Set as default HOME app
    - On first reboot after install you will be asked to select default Launcher, select ImmichFrame
    - Alternatively you can disable Frameo
      ```bash
      adb shell su
      pm disable net.frameo.frame
      exit
      ```
      If this doesn't stick on reboot, repeat the commands but power cycle after exit command
  - Some other useful ADB commands:
    - Reboot:
      ```bash
      adb reboot
      ``` 
        - You can also reboot or shutdown by holding down power button
    - Access Android Settings:
      ```bash 
      adb shell am start -a android.settings.SETTINGS
      ```
    - Re-enable Frameo: repeat disable commands above but replace "disable" with "enable"
    - Start Frameo app:
      ```bash 
      adb shell am start net.frameo.frame
      ```
    - Uninstall ImmichFrame:
      ```
      adb uninstall com.immichframe.immichframe
      ```

Follow instructions below to update WebView to 106. This has been tested and working on Android 6.01 10.1" Frameo devices:  
- Download WebView 106 to PC:
  [Lineage OS WebView 106-0-5249-126-12][webview-update]

  ```shell
  adb push /path/to/your/new/webview.apk /sdcard/
  ```
- Enter shell and switch to the root user
  ```shell
  adb shell
  ```
  then inside the shell
  ```shell
  su
  ```
- Backup original WebView APK
  ```shell
  mount -o rw,remount /system && cp /system/app/webview/webview.apk /system/app/webview/webview.apk.bak
  ```
- Delete the oat folder recursively
  ```shell
  mount -o rw,remount /system && rm -rf /system/app/webview/oat
  ```
- Copy new WebView to system    
  ```shell
  mount -o rw,remount /system && cp /sdcard/webview.apk /system/app/webview/webview.apk
  ```

Depending on the device or Android version, the location to the webview apk may be different for you. You can locate it with
