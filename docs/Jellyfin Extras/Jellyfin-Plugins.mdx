### KefinTweaks

Description: KefinTweaks is a comprehensive collection of enhancements and customizations for Jellyfin, focused on, but not limited to, filling gaps in functionality based on the community's most desired Feature Requests.

While working on these scripts to meet my personal needs, I noticed that there was a lot of overlap between the functionality I desire and many of the requested features by the community so I thought it would be a good idea to share this for anyone who may be interested.

There is no configuration required, but if you wish to customize some of the features, there are options to do so.

I think it's also worth mentioning that before the 1.0 release, you can expect to potentially encounter some issues or bugs. I try to address these as quickly as I can, and I appreciate your time for raising the issues in the first place!

Note: The Slideshow at the top of the Home Screen in the video below is from the MediaBar plugin by IAmParadox27 and MakD.
